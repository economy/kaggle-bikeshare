# A Jupyter Notebook Predicting Bikeshare Demand
## Are weather and seasonality good predictors for bikeshare demand in DC?

#### Via Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand

An attempt to play around with Kaggle Bikeshare data, exploring a couple scikit-learn gradient-boosted decision trees (GBMs):

- Classifier, implementing GradientBoostingClassifier object. Used to predict whether count of bike rentals by hour in the test set will exceed either 300 or 500
- Regressor, implementing GradientBoostingRegressor object. Used to predict absolute counts of bike rentals by hour in the test set.
